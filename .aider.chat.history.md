#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Chat with a friendly AI girlfriend who remembers past messages  
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make involve two files:

1. **mini-app/lib/metadata.ts** – update the `title` and `description` exported values.  
2. **mini-app/public/logo.png.todo** – create this new file to generate the app logo.

Please add `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for it. Once that’s added, I’ll also give you the content for `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo`.

A friendly AI girlfriend avatar with a warm smile, wearing a pastel-colored dress, standing against a soft gradient background of light blue and pink. The image should convey warmth and friendliness, with gentle lighting and a subtle glow around the figure. The background should be a smooth gradient from light blue at the top to soft pink at the bottom, creating a calm and inviting atmosphere. The avatar should be centered and slightly angled, with expressive eyes and a friendly posture. The overall composition should feel welcoming and approachable, suitable for an app logo.
